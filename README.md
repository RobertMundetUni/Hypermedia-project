The main user is a tech recruiter or hiring manager who needs to evaluate my candidacy quickly. This person receives many CVs every day, so they value clarity, structure, and good readability. They want to find key information like name, contact details, education, and recent experience in just a few seconds. They often read on a computer screen but also print CVs, so the design must work well in both formats. Their goal is to understand at a glance who I am, what I’ve studied, and what I’ve done professionally to decide if I’m a good fit for an interview.

I use a single page with a clear two-column layout to support two ways of reading. The left column tells my story. It starts with my identity (name and two quick links to LinkedIn and GitHub), then shows Academic Background first, and after that Work Experience. I put education before experience on purpose, so a recruiter can confirm my degree and dates right away. Each education item is a compact card with a short time label on the left (“Present”, “2023”, “2021”) and the degree and school on the right. This row structure keeps the timeline very easy to scan. Work entries follow a consistent pattern too: a small header with role, dates, company and location, and then a short bullet list that focuses on responsibilities, tools, and results. Using the same structure in every card reduces cognitive load and helps quick comparisons between roles. The right column works as a focused sidebar with quick facts a recruiter often needs: my photo at the top, then Contact (address, phone, email), Personal Information (date of birth, nationality, driving licence), Languages with simple progress bars, Abilities (soft skills) as a short list, and Technical Skills shown as clean, tappable chips. Splitting this data into small cards lets readers jump directly to what they want without reading the full narrative. On small screens the layout becomes one column and puts the identity and sidebar information first, so contact is always easy to find. For printing, the page simplifies to a single clean column to keep line length comfortable and avoid visual noise.

The visual design aims for calm, professional reading with strong clarity. I use a light background and dark text to keep contrast high and eye strain low. Content is divided into cards with soft shadows, rounded corners, and thin borders. This gives separation without heavy lines or bright blocks. Large uppercase section headers (like “ACADEMIC BACKGROUND” and “WORK EXPERIENCE”) act as anchors so the eye can move fast between sections. Body text uses comfortable sizing and line height, and I avoid long paragraphs. Lists use simple bullets so each idea is quick to read. Visual rhythm and alignment are important. Education and work cards share the same spacing, so the page feels stable while you scroll. In the sidebar, the photo sits inside a rounded frame; images use “cover”, so the face stays centered and sharp. Contact rows pair small monochrome icons with text; the icons are decorative, so they do not distract screen readers. The header buttons for LinkedIn and GitHub are compact, include small icons, and lift slightly on hover to show that they are clickable without shouting. On mobile, the grid collapses smoothly to one column; spacing remains generous, the photo shrinks to a neat square, and text stays readable. The language bars animate gently after load, adding a subtle sense of craft, but all information is still visible if scripts are off.
