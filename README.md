The main user is a tech recruiter or hiring manager who needs to evaluate my candidacy quickly. This person receives many CVs every day, so they value clarity, structure, and good readability. They want to find key information like name, contact details, education, and recent experience in just a few seconds. They often read on a computer screen but also print CVs, so the design must work well in both formats. Their goal is to understand at a glance who I am, what I’ve studied, and what I’ve done professionally to decide if I’m a good fit for an interview.

The information architecture follows single-page, two-column layout designed for fast reading and easy printing. The left column shows the main content the Academic Background and Work Experience. In the Academic Background section, each education entry uses a timeline layout where a fixed-width year rail appears next to flexible text. This makes the chronology clear without overloading the design.
The Work Experience section follows a consistent pattern: job title and dates on one line, the company name below, and then a short list of responsibilities and tools used. This order matches how recruiters scan: title → dates → company → highlights, ensuring information is always accessible.
The right column works as a sidebar and stays visible across the page. It includes Contact Information, Personal Details, Languages, and Skills & Abilities, all placed in small “cards” for quick access and easier reference.
At the top of the sidebar there is a photo that immediately identifies the candidate.The layout is built using CSS Grid, which keeps proportions flexible: the main content adapts to the available space while the sidebar remains narrow and stable. On smaller screens, the sidebar moves to the top and the content stacks vertically, keeping everything clear, readable, and visually well balanced.

The visual design is professional, clean, and easy to read, matching recruiter expectations for a technical CV. Typography uses a system-UI font stack at 14px with 1.45 line height, balancing compact text with good legibility for lists and long sentences. The contrast between a white main area and a dark sidebar (#242525) helps guide the reader’s eyes: the left side focuses on content, while the right side anchors the layout visually. Headings are uppercase and bold, creating clear visual anchors. The left column uses strong horizontal rules to separate major sections, while the sidebar uses thinner white lines for a lighter look. The photo now spans the full sidebar width and keeps the face centered with object-fit: cover and a top band that adds a clean, modern edge.
The bullet lists use custom, top-aligned markers to keep spacing consistent and visually tidy across browsers. Margins and padding are tight but balanced, making the content feel compact without being crowded.The entire design adapts for smaller screens: the sidebar becomes a header, spacing increases slightly, and the photo resizes gracefully. Overall, the visual style focuses on clarity, balance, and readability, using a modern layout that prints cleanly and works well on any device.
