The primary user is a tech recruiter or hiring manager who must evaluate my candidacy quickly. They expect immediate clarity on who I am, how to contact me, what I’ve studied, and what I’ve done most recently.

The information architecture follows a single-page, two-column layout designed for rapid comprehension and reliable printing. The left column carries the core narrative in two stacked sections: Academic Background and Work Experience. Academic Background reads as a compact timeline where a fixed-width year rail precedes the flexible details area (degree and institution), so chronology is captured at a glance without overwhelming the eye. Work Experience repeats a predictable micro-pattern for each role: a tight header line pairing role title with dates, a company line immediately beneath for attribution, and a concise bullet list that surfaces responsibilities, tools, and impact. This uniform structure supports the recruiter’s habitual scan path—title → dates → employer → highlights—while keeping line lengths comfortable. Semantically, the content is grouped with section and article boundaries, clear heading levels, and real unordered lists, which improves keyboard navigation, machine readability, and print fidelity. The right column acts as a persistent sidebar that consolidates Contact, Personal Information, Languages, and Skills & Abilities into compact cards, preceded by a full-width photo to establish identity instantly. This arrangement lets secondary but essential data remain visible while the reader moves through the narrative on the left. At page level, CSS Grid defines a flexible main track that absorbs extra width and a clamped sidebar that stays narrow and consistent across devices; internal grids handle the academic timeline and job blocks for crisp alignment. The result is a single page where the most decision-making content appears first, supporting quick screening.


The visual design is deliberately restrained and professional to match recruiter expectations for a technical CV while remaining comfortable for longer reads. Typography uses a modern system-UI stack set around 14px with ~1.45 line height, balancing compact density with legibility across multi-line bullets. Contrast establishes hierarchy: a white reading surface for the main column maximizes text clarity, while a dark, stable sidebar (#242525) frames the supporting information and anchors the page visually. Section titles are uppercase and weighty to create strong landmarks; on the left, titles are punctuated with assertive horizontal rules that segment major content blocks, whereas on the right, finer rules keep headers light against the dark background. The photo in the sidebar spans full width; object-fit and object-position are tuned so the face is well framed without distortion, and a subtle top band and angled shadow treatment at the bottom give the image a crisp edge and sense of depth. Lists use custom, top-aligned bullets to prevent the native marker from vertically centering on multi-line items, preserving a clean rhythm across browsers. Spacing is governed by small, deliberate gaps rather than large margins, so cards feel compact yet breathable. Page-level grid decisions ensure the left column flexes naturally while the sidebar remains consistently narrow, and the whole composition degrades gracefully on smaller screens and prints cleanly with minimal style overrides. Overall, the palette, type, and spacing choices emphasize clarity, scannability, and a contemporary but understated tone.
